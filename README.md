# This project have been created in sometime about 1989.

At that time each text editor had a proprietary format and support for import/export to a different text editor was very bad, this program allowed the conversion between different file formats.

This project have been added here just to remember me how was to learn coding when the only knowledge source I had was a book.


## Coding before internet :)
