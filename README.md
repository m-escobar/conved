# This project have been created in sometime about 1989, when DTP (Desktop Publishing Systems) started to be used in production for industrial printing process.

When Desktop publishing systems started to be used in the production, the biggest problems was the text importing from many text editors to DTP systems, and for Portuguese language text the second problem was hyphenation.

This program have been used to address these two problems, converting files from different text editor's to a specific DTP file format, and also including a virtual hyphen in each word position where Portuguese hyphenation was possible.

### This project have been added here just to remember me how was to learn coding when the only knowledge source I had was a book.


### Coding before internet :)
